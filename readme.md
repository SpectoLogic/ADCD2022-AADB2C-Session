# ADCD2022 - Austrian Developer Community Day 25.02.2022
## Identity and access management for consumer-focused applications

This repo contains the sample code and slides from my presentation at the [Austrian Developer Community Day 2022](https://hopin.com/events/adcd2022).

The sample uses nuget packages that I have published. The source code for this packages can be found here:

- [Source code for SpectoLogic.Identity.EasyAuth](https://github.com/SpectoLogic/SpectoLogic.Identity.EasyAuth)
- [Source code for API-connector-utilties-for-AADB2C](https://github.com/SpectoLogic/API-connector-utilties-for-AADB2C)
